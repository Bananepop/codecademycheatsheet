After finishing the HTML and CSS module on Codecademy, I was assigned a project called 'Build Your Own Cheat Sheet.' This project was different from others I had encountered on Codecademy so far. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, it involved a series of open-ended requirements such as:

1. My project should document at least one HTML or CSS topic. I chose "CSS Selectors and specificity" because when I was studying them I had a very difficult time understanding them. So, this project became a perfect opportunity to put into practice and review everything I learned.
2. My site should use HTML tables to display the documentation. In my project, I used a table with columns for:
   
  * Selector types
  * Description
  * Syntax
  * Examples

3. My site should utilize a custom color scheme.
4. My site should use custom styles for any code such as HTML tags or CSS properties or values. I also had to represent code using a monospace font family and a different background color.

I am very proud of what I did. I know it could be improved, but to be my first project without following a step-by-step tutorial, it turned out awesome!
